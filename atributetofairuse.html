Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get
better. It's not.
</a>

<a id="regan1text" href="#regan1" style="color:blue">
Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. It is not ours
by inheritance; it must be fought for and defended constantly by each
generation.</a>

<a id="regan2text" href="#regan2" style="color:blue">
Freedom is the right to question and change the established way of doing
things. It is the continuous revolution of the marketplace. It is the
understanding that allows [us] to recognize shortcomings and seek solutions.
</a>

<a id="jfk1text" href="#jfk1" style="color:orchid">
In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the
role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from
this responsibility — I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would
exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the
faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and
all who serve it — and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.
</a>

<a id="buddhatext" href="#buddha" style="color:olive">
Thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle, and the life of the
candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared.
</a>

<a id="matthew5:16text" href="#matthew5:16" style="color:red">
Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds.
</a>

<a id="jeffersontext" href="#jefferson" style="color:navy">
He who lights his candle at mine, receives light without darkening me.
</a>

<a id="regan3text" href="#regan3" style="color:blue">
You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve for our children
this, the last best hope of man on Earth, or we will sentence them to take the
last step into a thousand years of darkness.
</a>

<a id="as2text" href="#as2" style="color:orange">
There’s a battle going on right now, a battle to define everything that happens
on the Internet in terms of traditional things that the law understands. New
technology, instead of bringing us greater freedom, would have snuffed out
fundamental rights we had always taken for granted.
</a>

<a id="lincolntext" href="#lincoln" style="color:chocolate">
With malice toward none, with charity for all ... let us strive on to finish
the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds ... to do all which may
achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all
nations.
</a>

<a id="as1text" href="#as1" style="color:orange">
Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it
for themselves. The world’s entire scientific and cultural heritage, published
over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and
locked up.
</a>

<a id="moglen1text" href="#moglen1" style="color:black">
You can’t share it, because your best way of making money from it is to own it,
and to keep other people from it. That may be okay [for] real estate, but is it
okay [for] knowledge? That may be okay [for] diamonds, but is it okay [for]
culture? That may be all right when what it means is that the poor don’t have
Lexus, but is it okay when it means the poor don’t have physics?

<a id="douglasstext" href="#douglass" style="color:sienna">
No man can put a chain about the ankle of his fellow man without at last
finding the other end fastened about his own neck.
</a>

<a id="machiavellitext" href="#machiavelli" style="color:goldenrod">
For it is the common good and not private gain that makes cities great.
</a>

<a id="gal5:13text" href="#gal5:13" style="color:red">
Do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve
one another.
</a>

<a id="col3:12text" href="#col3:12" style="color:red">
Clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.
</a>

<a id="rmstext" href="#rms" style="color:green">
Things like freedom and the expansion of knowledge are beyond success, beyond
the personal. Personal success is not wrong, but it is limited in importance,
and once you have enough of it it is a shame to keep striving for that, instead
of for truth, beauty, or justice.
</a>

<a id="as3text" href="#as3" style="color:orange">
Think deeply about things. Don’t just go along because that’s the way things
are or that’s what your friends say. Consider the effects, consider the
alternatives, but most importantly, just think.
</a>

<a id="phil4:8text" href="#phil4:8" style="color:red">
Whatever is true ... noble ... right ... pure ... lovely, ... admirable
excellent, or praiseworthy—think about such things.
</a>

<a id="rom12:2text" href="#rom12:2" style="color:red">
Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind. 
</a>

<a id="malcomtext" href="#malcom" style="color:grey">
Once you change your philosophy, you change your thought pattern. Once you
change your thought pattern, you change ... your attitude. Once you change
your attitude, it changes your behavior pattern and then you go on into some
action.
</a>

<a id="whitfordtext" href="#whitford" style="color:indigo">
Action is the antidote to apathy and cynicism and despair. You will inevitably
make mistakes. Learn what you can and move on. At the end of your days, you
will be judged by your gallop, not by your stumble. 
</a>


<a id="regan4text" href="#regan4" style="color:blue">
It’s all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It’s all part of
taking a chance and expanding man’s horizons. The future doesn’t belong to the
fainthearted; it belongs to the brave.
</a>

<a id="churchilltext" href="#churchill" style="color:aqua">
Never, never, never, never - in nothing, great or small, large or petty - never
give in, except to convictions of honor and good sense.
</a>

<a id="sagantext" href="#sagan" style="color:violet">
We have the power to decide the fate of our planet and ourselves. This is a
time of great danger, but our species is young, and curious, and brave. It
shows much promise.
</a>

<a id="machiavelli2text" href="#machiavelli2" style="color:goldenrod">
It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand,
more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the
lead in the introduction of a new order of things.
</a>

<a id="col3:23text" href="#col3:23" style="color:red">
Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart.
