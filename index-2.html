Someone posted to the Fedora-Join list this week with questions about Fedora
Cloud, and cloud in general (see: <a target="_blank" href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/fedora-join/2015-May/000333.html">https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/fedora-join/2015-May/000333.html</a>).
Mattdm, Fedora Project Lead, wrote a *fantastic* response that I think warrants
resharing below.
</p>

<pre>
Your confusion is understandable, because "cloud" has become a
marketing buzzword and is often applied to the things you've described.
But that's not quite what we mean here.

"Cloud computing" is the idea of providing the fundamental compute
resources — cpu cycles, storage, and memory — as a service. In this
model, rather than having these things on-site in a server room, you
pay a metered price to a utility company. "The cloud" in this sense is
like the grid from which we draw electric power.

Instead of energy companies, the providers are Amazon (EC2), Google
(Compute Engine), Microsoft (Azure), Digital Ocean, and others. And
this isn't science fiction — if you have a startup (especially one
where you want to try new things and may need to scale up (_and down_!)
quickly, this is how things are done now. And, it's appealing to large
companies as well, where an on-premises cloud based on something like
(open source!) OpenStack lets your IT department become an in-house
utility provider to your developers.

So: Fedora Cloud is simply an instance of Fedora optimized to run in
this environment. If you go to https://getfedora.org/en/cloud/download/
and click on one of the Amazon EC2 images at the bottom of the page,
you can launch a new remote Fedora system in minutes. And, you can use
this as a sort of self-service hosting provider, if you like, but the
important thing is that you can actually also access all control of the
machine via an API, which means you can build systems that
automatically scale up (and again, down) as needed.

But, at this point, Fedora Cloud is just that basic building block, and
doesn't actually provide any cloud-based _services_. For that, one
approach is to use popular container technology Docker on top of Fedora
Cloud — read more in this recent Fedora Magazine article:
<http:></http:>
and take a look at <https:>
for practical examples, which includes among other things OwnCloud (a
remote storage solution) and Wordpress (the blogging software, of
course).

This blogpost has been making the rounds on the Social Medias as of late:
</p>

<p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.svpino.com/2015/05/07/five-programming-problems-every-software-engineer-should-be-able-to-solve-in-less-than-1-hour">https://blog.svpino.com/2015/05/07/five-programming-problems-every-software-engineer-should-be-able-to-solve-in-less-than-1-hour</a>
</p>

<p>
I'm sure many of my hacker peeps read this article and thought to themselves
"YASSS! This guy is so totally right!!1! Why n00bs gotta n00b! RTFM, Br0!"
</p>

<p>
This stuff is <strong>toxic</strong>, will not help onboard new devs, or
improve the habits of careless devs. I feel your pain, but this isn't going to
actually solve your problem, but conflate it by creating a hostile environment.
This is a classic case of <strong>#doingitwrong</strong></p>

<p>
I understand that the author is frustrated with sub-par candidates applying for
positions they are not qualified for, but this kind of: "You are not allowed to
even identify as a ________ until you meet my list of arbitrary requirements"
is dangerous.
</p>

<p>
Yes, it would be nice if everyone applying to your open position could solve
these problems, but that group of people you are bemoaning here, those who are
irreverently spamming their resumes everywhere, are not going to care about
this post, or what you think qualifies them. They are just playing the
job-lottery...
</p>

<p>
You know who <strong>will</strong> care and take it very seriously? All the
aspiring programmers and software engineers, who you just told were not good
enough to even <em>call themselves</em> or even <em>think of themselves</em> as
a programmer... Why would you want to work with people who don't think you are
good enough or worth it?
</p>

<p>
You can say someone is not qualified for a position, but <em>please</em> don't
try to tell someone who they are, or how they should think about themselves.
Everyone has to start somewhere. Programmers do not emerge fully-formed from
the womb--they learn from others, and from failure.

So, in it's most-purest most-rawest most-honest form, you can find a number of raw transcripts in the new  repo: <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/decause/raw"><strong>decause/raw</strong></a></p>

<p>18,529 words, or, just over 41 pages total of raw text.</p>

<p>There is a flaw in my workflow. Though there is some utility in a raw transcript, really it is mostly when delivered in real-time. After the fact, there is much post-production work to be done, like spell checking. Even after, if there is a video, then the transcript is partial, and incomplete. This is bothersome to many potential downstream consumers of raw text. So where does that leave us?</p>

<h2>Word Clouds</h2>

<img width="100%" src="blog/that-rugged-raw/biellamollyastragrey.png"><img width="100%" src="blog/that-rugged-raw/pycon_grey.png"><p>I've played with <code>word_cloud</code> before within my <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/decause/presinaug">decause/presignaug</a> for building

Thank you everyone for your input and advice on my previous post about Soylent.
Folks seem pretty divided on this particular lifehack, and now I have a much
better idea of why, and what the shortcomings of Soylent's current formula are. 
</p>

<p>
Though there is much to be desired in the 1.4 version of Soylent, it is better
than the 1.0 version of Drive-Thru nutrition that I've been apt to subsist upon
as of late. 
</p>

<p>
I've only got enough for a couple of days, but that should be enough to know
whether or not I can stomach it. So far, I've lucked out and I don't hate the
taste, though I did wait until I was *rilly* hungry before "eating" to trick my
body into enjoying it more ;)
</p>

<p>
Meal #1 was a success, and I'm bringing Meal #2 with me today to campus.

    <p>One of my students tagged me in an issue on GitHub about helping new contributors during the National Day of Civic Hacking. After spending some time writing the comment, I decided to repost it here :)</p>

<p>Orig thread here: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/issues/668#issuecomment-90155612">https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/issues/668</a> reply here: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/issues/668#issuecomment-90155612">https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/issues/668#issuecomment-90155612</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the past, many local event organizers have had agencies reach out to them directly and offer to partner on specific projects and initiatives (our local events in Rochester have featured challenges and speakers from the EPA, for example.) I would recommend reaching out to the national organizers, and seeing if you can get a list of cities/events that are not already partnered with a federal agency, or see if they will put your projects out on blast during the next organizer's call.
</p>

<p>
Either way, the most important thing for getting new contributions, IMHO, is to be sure you have *clear* action items, that are surmountable in the time of the event, with *dedicated* upstream mentors ready to synchronously provide feedback. That sounded kinda buzzword-y, so:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Clear action item(s) (FIX #1337: CSS Bug on http://github.com/18f/18f.gsa.gov/issues/668)</li>
    <li>Clear documentation (README with instructions for getting stack up and running, styleguides, etc...)</li>
    <li>Person in IRC/Chat actively answering questions from contributors, and ideally hacking with them.</li>
</ol>
<p> SecondMuse historically does a great job vetting the "problems" that
agencies come up with, so working with them will likely help with that first
bullet point. </p>

 <p> There is *nothing* worse than spending an entire hackathon trying to get
"to the starting blocks" and failing to get a stack just up and running. It is
demoralizing, and makes new contributors very discouraged. Be sure that
whatever contributions you are looking to garner have stacks that can be
trivially installed on Linux/Mac/Windows. (i.e. - shipping a
<code>requirements.txt</code> or <code>setup.py</code> with your python
project, or even better, distributing to http://pypi.python.org for easy
installation.) </p>

 <p> Having that mentor available to kick down blockers and vgrep tracebacks is
the difference between a new contributor spending 3 hours hunting down an
error, or a mentor providing that
'obvious-to-them-seen-it-a-million-times-one-liner-fix' in 3 minutes. If you
can get mentor that can commit to the *entire* event, that is a super amazing
morale boost for new contributors. There is a certain magic in looking in
channel or around room and seeing upstream hacking right alongside you in the
trenches deep into the wee hours of the morning. </p>
