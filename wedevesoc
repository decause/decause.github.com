May our cups grow less heavy and our aim eversteady
May our knights stand steadfast stalwart and eveready
May our minstrels strum drum pick pluck and play on 
May our Heroes and Legends live on till we're gone 

So here's to you and here's to me 
The Exalted Society of Wednesday Eve
Here's to the dragons and here's to the knights
So brandish your cups and
Fight the Good Fight!
