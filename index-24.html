<blockquote>
    While at OSCON 2015 I watched a presentation that I felt was trollish and
    flamebaity--stoking the fires of FOSS Holy war just for the sake of
    stirring up controversy. This opinion, though expressed by a well-known
    organizational leader, I felt lacked legal and business acumen, and
    presented a very flat and trite reasoning for forgoing copyleft licenses. I
    have heard legitimate arguments--and I will continue to be a license
    pluralist--but all of them were stronger than "here is a kitten. You can't
    argue with a kitten."

    Even the "strongest" arguments I heard "There are now foundations to
    steward FOSS projects" which is at worst, a stunningly glorious conflict of
    interest, and at best, not taking into account the legal and policy
    realities of a post-citizen's united IRS, who started issuing BOLOs for
    applicants using the term "Open Source" in 2010: via EFF
    (https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/open-source-madness), source here:
    http://democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/sites/democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/files/November%202010%20BOLO%20IRS0000001349-IRS0000001364.pdf

    I could continue, but this isn't even going to show up in the copy so I'll
    get back to attempting to be brief...

</figure><p>I am a license pluralist. I think Author and contributor choice of
distribution is important, and we need to have as diverse a toolbox of legal
instruments as possible, to fit as varied a field of softwares as we can
conceive.</p>

<p><strong>But</strong></p>

<p>
The "Freedom to close" is not a freedom. 
</p>
<p>
The "Freedom to exploit" is not a freedom.
</p>

If someone said "I'd love to help you write a book, so long as I can take the
manuscript and publish it on my own at any time, without giving you credit or
compensation," would you be all like "that sounds someone who has
<em><strong>MY</strong></em> best interests at heart!"
-->

<p>
Your organization not adopting copyleft software, is not a failing of copyleft,
it is a failing of your organization to participate <em>authentically</em> in
an Open ecosystem of innovation. It is your organization saying <em>"I want to
keep my options open, in case there is ever a time when it would be convenient
to cut you out of the equation."</em>
</p>

<p>
Folks might say "Yeah, that is what doing business at arm's length is!" or "By
nature, people are greedy and/or selfish!"
</p>

<p>
And that is exactly why we have contracts and licenses! We use them all the
time in non-copyleft contexts to ensure that both parties hold up their end of
a clearly defined agreement.
</p>

<p>
So why-oh-why is there some sort of <strong><em>virtue</em></strong> in
entering into an agreement that would allow the other party to renege? The
freedom to break a social or business contract whenever it is convenient,
implies that you think you can outmanoeuvre the other party, and that your
strategy's real strength is subterfuge, not what you bring to the table.
</p>

<p>
That is not what genuine collaboration is. It is an okey doke, and contributors
are falling for it left and right against their own interests.

Mathematics and Science move forward because of the accountability that comes

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ant_and_the_Grasshopper

Did the Little Red Hen let any of the animals who didn't do the work eat the
bread? 

(Well, really this is a parable about free riders and coattailing, which
doesn't lend itself quite as well to FOSS, because those things actually
generate value when done properly. If bread didn't take any* material inputs,
and the feedback of the animals about the bread could be utilized to make
future iterations better...)

*: any meaning material inputs that have a marginal reproduction cost that
asymptotically approaches zero

You can ad hominem RMS all you'd like.

You can point to the historically counter-culture of position of copyleft in
the FOSS Movement; but Copyleft *is* the strongest protection for your IP, and
though it is not more popular than copyright, it is mainstream now.

There *are* times when using the GPL is inadvisable. I have heard only
<em>ONE</em> business case for a security and exploit aggregation framework
that collects all the holes in your system. Someone could make a request for
your source under the GPL (in theory) to get a list of all those holes. The
project choose to permissively license the data file definitions and
configuration files that describe the security holes. That is the only viable
use-case I have ever heard. I'm *constantly* looking for others.
