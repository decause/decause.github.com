Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get
better. It's not.

<a id="Reagan1text" href="#Reagan1" style="color:blue">
<abbr title="Ronald Reagan, California Gubernatorial Inauguration Speech (5 January 1967)">
Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. It is not ours
by inheritance; it must be fought for and defended constantly by each
generation.</abbr></a>
<br/>
<br/>

<a id="Reagan2text" href="#Reagan2" style="color:blue">
<abbr title="Ronald Reagan, Republican National Convention Annual Gala (3 February 1994)">
Freedom is the right to question and change the established way of doing
things. It is the continuous revolution of the marketplace. It is the
understanding that allows [us] to recognize shortcomings and seek solutions.
</abbr></a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<a id="jfk1text" href="#jfk1" style="color:orchid">
<abbr title="John F. Kennedy, Inaugural address, Washington D.C. (20 January 1961)">
In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the
role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger... I do not believe
that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other
generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor
will light our country and all who serve it — and the glow from that fire can
truly light the world.

He who lights his candle at mine, receives light without darkening me
</abbr></a>

<a id="buddhatext" href="#buddha" style="color:olive">

being shared.

<a id="Reagan3text" href="#Reagan3" style="color:blue">
<abbr title="Ronald Reagan, A Time for Choosing (27 October 1964)">
You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve for our children
this, the last best hope of man on Earth, or we will sentence them to take the
last step into a thousand years of darkness.
</abbr></a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<a id="as2text" href="#as2" style="color:orange">
<abbr title="Aaron Swartz, F2C:Freedom to Connect 2012. Washington, D.C. (21 May 2012)">
There’s a battle going on right now, a battle to define everything that happens
on the Internet in terms of traditional things that the law understands. New
technology, instead of bringing us greater freedom, would have snuffed out
fundamental rights we had always taken for granted.
</abbr></a>

<a id="lincolntext" href="#lincoln" style="color:chocolate">
<abbr title="Abraham Lincoln, Second Inaugural Address, (4 March 1865)">
With malice toward none, with charity for all ... let us strive on to finish
the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds ... to do all which may
achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all
nations.
</abbr></a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<a id="as1text" href="#as1" style="color:orange">
<abbr title="Aaron Swartz, Guerilla Open Access Manifesto (July 2008)">
Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it
for themselves. The world’s entire scientific and cultural heritage, published
over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and
locked up.
</abbr></a>

<a id="moglen1text" href="#moglen1" style="color:black">
<abbr title="Eben Moglen, Plenary session at Nonprofit Technology Conference in San Francisco, (28 April 2009)">
You can’t share it, because your best way of making money from it is to own it,
and to keep other people from it. That may be okay [for] real estate, but is it
okay [for] knowledge? That may be okay [for] diamonds, but is it okay [for]
culture? That may be all right when what it means is that the poor don’t have
Lexus, but is it okay when it means the poor don’t have physics?

Clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.
</abbr></a>

<a id="rmstext" href="#rms" style="color:green">
<abbr title="Richard Stallman, Znet Inteview (18 December 2005)">
Things like freedom and the expansion of knowledge are beyond success, beyond
the personal. Personal success is not wrong, but it is limited in importance,
and once you have enough of it it is a shame to keep striving for that, instead
of for truth, beauty, or justice.
</abbr></a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<a id="as3text" href="#as3" style="color:orange">
<abbr title="Aaron Swartz, UTI interview, (23 January 2004)">
Think deeply about things. Don’t just go along because that’s the way things
are or that’s what your friends say. Consider the effects, consider the
alternatives, but most importantly, just think.
</abbr></a>

<a id="phil4:8text" href="#phil4:8" style="color:red">

Whatever is true ... noble ... right ... pure ... lovely, ... admirable

<a id="malcomtext" href="#malcom" style="color:grey">
<abbr title="Malcom X, Speech at the Congress for Racial Equality, in Detroit, Michigan (12 April 1964)">
Once you change your philosophy, you change your thought pattern. Once you
change your thought pattern, you change ... your attitude. Once you change
your attitude, it changes your behavior pattern and then you go on into some
action.
</abbr></a>

<a id="whitfordtext" href="#whitford" style="color:indigo">
<abbr title="Bradley Whitford, Spring Commencement at University of Wisconsin, (15 May 2004)">
Action is the antidote to apathy and cynicism and despair. You will inevitably
make mistakes. Learn what you can and move on. At the end of your days, you
will be judged by your gallop, not by your stumble. 
</abbr></a>

<a id="Reagan4text" href="#Reagan4" style="color:blue">
<abbr title="Ronald Reagan, Speech about the Space Shuttle disaster (28 January 1986)">
It’s all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It’s all part of
taking a chance and expanding man’s horizons. The future doesn’t belong to the
fainthearted; it belongs to the brave.
</abbr></a>

<a id="churchilltext" href="#churchill" style="color:aqua">
<abbr title="Winston Churchill, Harrow School, (29 October 1941)">
Never, never, never, never - in nothing, great or small, large or petty - never
give in, except to convictions of honor and good sense.
</abbr></a>

<a id="sagantext" href="#sagan" style="color:violet">
<abbr title="Carl Sagan, Cosmos: A Personal Voyage (1990 Update)">
We have the power to decide the fate of our planet and ourselves. This is a
time of great danger, but our species is young, and curious, and brave. It
shows much promise.
</abbr></a>

<a id="machiavelli2text" href="#machiavelli2" style="color:goldenrod">
<abbr title="Niccolo Machiavelli, The Prince, (1469 - 1527)">
It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand,
more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the
lead in the introduction of a new order of things.
