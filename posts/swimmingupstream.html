 <p>By now, many of you have <a target="_blank"
href="http://fedoramagazine.org/5tftw-2015-02-13/">heard the news</a>, but for
those of you who haven't...  I have the distinct honor of being the first <a target="_blank"
href="http://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-community-action-and-impact-job-opening-red-hat-osas/">Fedora
Community Action and Impact Lead</a>, hired by <a target="_blank"
href="http://redhat.com">Red Hat</a>, and appointed to the <a target="_blank"
href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Council">Fedora Council</a>.</p>

<p>This role has many aspects (see: <a target="_blank"
href="http://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-community-action-and-impact-job-opening-red-hat-osas/">Job
Description</a>), and I look forward to finding out more about it during my
orientation at HQ in Raleigh.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I've had <strong>a lot</strong> of folks asking me
<strong>a lot</strong> of the same questions, so I've put together this handy
FAQ.</p>

<br/>
<hr/>
<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3><a id="two" href="#two">Q: Will you be leaving RIT?</a></h3>
<p>In some ways, yes, in some ways, not entirely (at least not yet.) I will be
resigning from my staff position with the MAGIC Center effective immediately,
but I will finish out this semester teaching the <a target="_blank"
href="http://hfoss-ritigm.rhcloud.com">Humanitarian FOSS Development</a> and <a
target="_blank" href="http://bizlegfoss-ritigm.rhcloud.com">Business/Legal
Environment of Free/Open Source Software</a> courses. My time on campus will be
limited to scheduled class time and office hours until the end of Spring
Semester (May 20th is my last final exam.) As the team I am joining at Red Hat
includes University Relations, and I have a unique perspective on this
first-of-its-kind academic program, I will <em>very likely</em> be kept in the
loop on both the RIT-side, and the Red Hat-side.</p>

<!--RIT will no
longer be my primary concern, but there are many opportunities to engage with
local FOSS folks on my new primary concern, Fedora Users and Developers.</p>
-->

<h3><a id="one" href="#one">Q: Will you be leaving Rochester?</a></h3>
<p>No, not for the foreseeable future. The FCL position is a remote position,
and will require travel, but I do not anticipate even <em>considering</em>
relocation until after <a target="_blank"
href="http://fedoramagazine.org/flock-2015-rochester-institute-of-technology/">FLOCK
2015</a> at the absolute earliest.</p>

<h3><a id="three" href="#three">Q: ZOMG! Does this mean the end of
the FOSSBox?</a></h3>

<p>Certainly Not! Prof. Stephen Jacobs and a larger-than-ever core of students
will keep the wheels on the wagon until a Remy-replacement arrives.</p>

<h3><a id="four" href="#four">Q: So... when <em>does</em> the cavalry arrive?</a></h3>
<p>Great question! This is an opportunity for MAGIC to reevaluate their needs,
and hire a person (or persons I hope) who can support the FOSS initiative,
infrastructure, and general operations. I'm hopeful there'll be a job listing
in the next couple of weeks, and the process can begin asap. Hopefully we'll
see some hiring(s) before the end of the semester, but certainly by fall of
next year. MAGIC will move as quickly as the RIT HR process will allow I'm
sure.</p>

<h3><a id="six" href="#six">Q: So, what happens to the FOSS minor? It isn't
going to go away is it?</a></h3>
<p>Nope! The minor can't be undone now that <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.rit.edu/gccis/igm/sites/rit.edu.gccis.igm/files/docs/foss-mn_semesters.pdf">it
is official and on the books</a>. In fact, we're hoping to
<strong><underline><em>double</em></underline></strong> the number of enrolled
students by the end of the academic year. When(if?) I vacate my role as an
instructor, The IGM department and SJ will make a list of eligible degree
holding individuals qualified and interested in teaching these courses at RIT,
and will know how best to fill that role. So far as content and instruction, it
is my impression that the pedagogical and instructional model of course
delivery we've developed with the help of Professors Jacobs, Shein, Sherrill,
Bean, and many students/alumni (shout-out <a target="_blank"
href="http://gearchicken.com/wordpress/">loothelion</a>, <a target="_blank"
href="http://rsb.io">ryansb</a>) will remain at the core of minor. As a
Hackademic <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/fossrit/ofcourse">and
upstream developer of educational software</a> I plan to continue promoting
Free/Open alternatives to the <s>wasteland of predatory Academic Software and LMS's</s> variety of quality
Academic Software and LMS's I've seen during my time as a student and
instructor.</p>

<h3 id="four" href="#four">Q: So, can you get me Red Hat/Fedora Swag then, right?</h3>
<p>Sort of. I can help, but you gotta adhere to protocol and <a target="_blanK"
href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Ambassadors_North_America_%28FAMNA%29#Get_SWAG_for_Your_Event">
file a ticket on the Trac</a>.

<h3><a id="five" href="#five">Q: So obviously now you can totally get me free RHEL, right?</a></h3>
<p>No... See: <a target="_blank" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux</a>

<h3><a id="seven" href="#seven">Q: So, you're going to stop hanging out in #rit-foss?</a></h3>
<p>No way! It just means you'll also be able to find me in
#fedora-{devel,design,meeting,fedmsg,*...}</p>

<h3><a id="eight" href="#eight">Q: So, you can totally get me a job at Red Hat, right?</a></h3>
<p>Maybe. If you find a position listed on <a target="_blank"
href="http://jobs.redhat.com">http://jobs.redhat.com</a> and send me a link to
the listing, I can at least help you begin the process. From what I know about
FOSS driven organizations, they seem more likely to hire active
contributors and community members, so I would highly recommend diving
head-first into whatever stack or project you are most passionate about, and
applying thereafter. Here is a good place to start: <a target="_blank"

<h2>&lt;/IvoryTower&gt;</h2>
<p>It was over <strong>five</strong> long years ago when I returned to RIT for the
first time after my undergraduate studies with <a target="_blank"
href="http://lewk.org"</a>lmacken</a>, <a target="_blank"
href="https://twitter.com/gregdek">GregDek</a>, and <a target="_blank"
href="http://blog.melchua.com/">Mel Chua</a>, to meet with SJ for the first
time. SJ had orchestrated a jam-packed schedule for everyone to meet with
Deans, and Department Heads, and IT Administrators of all stripes. We resolved
after that visit to create the first ever Academic Minor in Free/Open Source
Software at a university in the United States, and by golly-gosh we did it! <a
target="_blank" href="http://www.rit.edu/news/story.php?id=51172">It was even
the #1 News Story published by RIT University News Services in 2014</a>! It
took a village, and a whole network of villages outside of that village, to
make the FOSS minor a reality, and now it is done. I've seen full life-cycles
of academic careers, from Freshmen to Graduate, start to finish. Every time
another student gets a grade in my course, or lands their first internship in
FOSS, or gets their first job after graduation, I think of this quote:</p>

<strong>
    <em>
        <blockquote>
            If your plan is for one year plant rice. <br/>
            If your plan is for ten years plant trees. <br/>
            If your plan is for one hundred years educate children.<br/>
            --Confucius 
        </blockquote>
    </em>
</strong>

<p>As a Hacktivist, I have always felt that Technological Literacy was the most
viable long-term strategy. It won't be fast, it won't be easy, it may not even
be cheap, but it will be Free. We've got a model now, one that I hope can be
replicated in other academic programs, iterated upon, and improved. It took us
a while, but for the first time I can say that I can safely walk away. RIT and
MAGIC can take the ball from here.</p>

<p>I will be ever-thankful for the opportunities that have been afforded to me
in Rochester, and the amazing community that has supported our work and our
students. Perhaps most of all, I am thankful for my grey-bearded mentor Steve
Jacobs, who has always treated me like a colleague, and been willing to
acclimate to the wildwest that FOSS communities can be. He's always been one to
bring everyone to the table, and without him, none of this would have been
possible. If there were one Steve Jacobs at every university, Open Education
would be a solved problem. Much Love SJ.</p>

<p>Students, you know that I'm not leaving as much as I'm swimming upstream, so
I don't need to say "goodbye" to any of you ;)</p>

<h2>&lt;Fedora&gt;</h2>
<p>Fedorans, I have been a user and advocate for years, and it is my privilege
to represent and serve you. Fedora, for years now, has been the bedrock upon
which my portal to the digital realm is affixed (I've been installing,
preupgrading and fedup-ing since Leonidas.) The prospect of taking the
community development, advocacy, and organizing skills I've been building here,
and applying them to growing a community of <em>millions</em> contributors and
users in every timezone, for the leading enterprise Linux provider on the
planet, is a humbling opportunity one can only dream of... Not all of you know
me, and I certainly don't know all of you, but I want to. Your contributions
have helped me all these years to get to where I am, and now it is my time to
return the favor. I cannot wait to tell your stories, support your efforts, and
hack alongside you. There is much to learn, and much to do, and I'm going to
need all the help I can get.</p>
