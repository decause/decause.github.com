<p>I stumbled upon semantic-ui whilst surfing, and immediately became
intrigued. It made sense, and it looked great! I had to try it for my new
static blog!</p>

<p>Sure, I could just generate the source for the widgets and css I wanted from
their docs, and hand-copied it into my various <code>static</code> folders, but
instead, I wanted to attempt to employ the power of build. It has been a long
while, but I'm slowly remembering how to wield themtharnewfangledjstoolschains,
aka Gulp, and bower, and npm.</p>

<p>Gulp and bower in particular are quite useful. Bower is like <code>pip
install</code> for javascript-y libraries. But before using bower, we gotta
install node. If there is one thing that I know I love, it is installing random
javascript code from the internet onto my machine globally. Everytime I see
things like this in a README file, I get very very sad:
</p>

<code>$ sudo npm install -g totally_legit_js_library</code>
<br/>
<code>$ sudo pip install totally_legit_python_library</code>

<p>
Please, don't sudo install the things, and certainly not globally, without
taking a moment to think if that is desirable or necessary. Don't get me wrong,
I sure don't grok all the way to the bottom of every stack I deploy, but this
is <em>exactly</em> why I try not to give any-ole stack the ability to run as
root.
</p>

<p>
On top of that, I've been taught you should *almost* always use a virtualenv,
or other safe and somewhat isolated micro-universe far away from your system
packages.
</p>

<p>
There are a number of solutions, but my favorite one thusfar has been
installing into a python virtualenv! One time at a hackathon, I blindly trusted
a teamate who encouraged me to just <code>curl</code> and <code>./</code> some
shell script off of a website somewhere to get <code>nvm</code> set up, which I
begrudgingly did, but have since discontinued the practice of. Here is what
I've been doing instead:

<p>
Yes, it takes longer, but there is something so satisfying about building from
source. I found that after I got node installed, I could <code>npm install -g
all-the-things</code> that I needed, and those would be conveniently located within
a python virtualenv that I'd likely be using to server up the static content
anways.

<p>So far, so good! I've got a working js toolchain, with my desired deps
installed! You can find the initial commits here: <a target="_blank"

<h2>Part II Goals</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strike>Get node and npm install on my local machine without requiring root</strike></li>
    <li><strike>Get a working <code>bower.json</code> package to install the things </strike></li>
    <li><strike>Get a working <code>gulpfile.js</code> package to move the installed things</strike></li>
    <li>Get a working <code>nikola deploy</code> workflow to run the gulpfile in addition to building the site!</li>
    <li>Incorporate semantic-ui cards into <code>fedmsg</code> feed, and possibly other aspects of site.</li>
</ol>


<p>Stay tuned for Part II!</p>
