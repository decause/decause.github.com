<h1>The 3 Pillars of Code.org; SIGCSE Keynote and Interview with Hadi
Partovi</h1>

<h3>America's Untapped Opportunity</h3>

<em>The following is a literary transduction based on a Keynote Address given
at 2014 SIGCSE conference by Hadi Partovi, founder of Code.org</em>

<p>Thanks for warm welcome!</p>

<p>
Last year, <a target="_blank" href="http://sigcse.org">SIGCSE</a> was a week
after our launch. It questioned our motives, and existence. We made a video,
and that that video got 12M views, so I built an org around it.</p>

<p>
This year, I was welcomed very warmly. I was up until 3am last night, which
helped remind me that Computer Science educators are not only the coolest, but
also the most innovative.
</p>

<p>
For those who aren't familiar with <a target="_blank"
href="http://Code.org">Code.org</a>, there are lots of opinions of what we are.
Lots of people think of us as a marketing org that makes videos of celebs, a
coalition of tech folks filling cs jobs, a political advocacy organization for
educators and technologists, the organizer of the <a target="_blank"
href="http://csedweek.org/">Hour of Code</a>, a software engineering house, a
curriculum writing team, and a grassroots movement to
bring together for-profit, non-profit, and Governmental organizations on a
united goal.
</p>

<p>Our vision: Computer Science taught in every school to every student. Not
required necessarily, but definitely the opportunity to take Computer Science
available to all.</p>

<h3>Three Things We Talk About:</h3> 
<ol>
    <li>Bridging the student/job gap. Politicians think about this <strong>a
        lot</strong></li>

    <li>Reaching underrepresented students, and the social justice implied in
    doing so.</li>

    <li>Computer Science is <em>foundational</em> for the 21st century.
    Doctors, lawyers, even the President of United States, <em>need</em> to
    know about this field.</li>
</ol>

<p>As early as 15 years ago, I asked our Dean why don't we do these things, he
said "give it 15 years, it will fix it self," But it didn't...</p>

<h3>The Myths:</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>1) We're all hype + <a target="_blank" href="https://code.org/educate/hoc">Hour of Code</a></dt>
    <dd>We have 15 staff at this event alone. <a target="_blank" href="http://code.org/about/team">We are always working.</a></dd>

    <dt>2) We want to do everything by ourselves</dt>
    <dd>In Reality, we have <a target="_blank" href="http://code.org/about/partners">over 100 partners</a> who help us do everything we do.</dd>

    <dt>3) we are only about "coding" or learning to code</dt>
        <dd>This is probably due to the name mostly, but If we called ourselves
        "computer science for the masses" would be csftm.org... which is just
        as confusing as any other acronym.</dd>

    <dt>4) People assume Code.org is about the software industry coming to tell
    schools how to do their jobs</dt>
        <dd>I have a Computer Science background, and I've gotten software
        companies to fund Code.org, but that doesn't mean they run it. Much of
        our money is spent in Kindergarten on kids who will never become
        computer scientists.</dd>

<blockquote>
    The difference between computational thinking versus programming for CS is
    clear to all of us, but for the average person it may be jumbled. We don't
    just want people to learn to code, we want people to learn to <em>think</em>.

    We <em>are</em> disrupting things--not the <em>natural</em> order, but the
    <em>previous</em> order. We want to disrupt education in a
    <strong>good</strong> way.
</blockquote>
</dl>

<h3>The Pillars of Code.org:</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>1) Educate</dt>
    <dd>Bring CS to all K12 schools in US. This is the biggest job we're trying
    to tackle. Making curriculum, and working within school districts.</dd>

    <dt>2) Advocate</dt>
        <dd>Remove legislative barriers, make CS part of core academic
        standards.</dd>

    <dt>3) Celebrate</dt>
        <dd>Combat stereotypes that prevent more students from joining in
        CS.</dd>

<h4>How did we do all this? Partnerships across Industry, Non-Profit,
    Government.</h4>
<ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/openness/default.aspx">Microsoft</a>/<a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/">Google</a>'s incredible generosity</li>

    <li>Our system is not known as the best, but our teachers are awesome.
    Going outside of regular classroom time to help fix the system.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pillar #1 - Educate</h3>

<strong>Code.org has a developed a <strong>FULL</strong> K-12 curriculum</strong>
<ul>
    <li>20 hour modules all the way to middle school</li>
    <li>Aligned to Common Core standards in math and ELA</li>
    <li>Middle school modules go into Math and Science classes. Teaching Math science via Computer Science</li>
    <li>High school intro course, and a high school AP course</li>
</ul>



<h4>Code.org has two different models for how we spread:</h4>

<strong>1) The Online Model:</strong>

<p>Putting more courses and curriculum online for teachers and students. The
lower the grade, the more freedom teachers seem to have.  3rd grade teachers
teach math, sure, but they are not <em>just</em> a math teacher, and can find
ways to integrate code into more activities. This is <strong>extremely</strong>
cost effective, <strong>about $0.05/student!</strong></p>

<strong>2) The District Model</strong>

<p>The district provides teachers, classrooms, computers we provide: stipend,
curriculum, and marketing. This helps make sure there is no cost to the school
for adopting a Computer Science curriculum. Managing costs for scale: around
$5K-10K/high school... $5,000 x 20,000 high schools who don't have CS... that
adds up...</p>

<strong>3) Alternatives</strong>

<p>Code.org is looking into developing things like:</p>

<ul>
    <li>State level Teacher Certification Exams</li>
    <li>Incentives/scholarships for studying CS in Schools of Education.</li>  
    <li>Building a pipeline of pre-service teachers</li>
</ul>

<p>
We've found the Holy Grail for online curriculum is to make learning
<strong>feel</strong> like a game. An online curriculum makes teacher's lives
easier.  This is not about making an "end-run" at teachers; Web-based
curriculum reduces the IT hassle Significantly! Most high school CS teachers in
this room, also double as the de facto IT person in the school! 
</p>


<em>(audible "yeses" and laughter heard around the room)</em>

<p>
As long as the IT Department doesn't black-list us, you can get to our IDE and
curriculum. We have a team of engineers working together to blend curriculum
and game design. We're still early on in evaluating the results. In the
web-world, you run the data through Hadoop and/or Hive, and we've got 10M
datapoints.
</p>

<h3>Some ways YOU can help</h3>

<h4>Universities:</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Bring a Computer Science Principles course to your institution</li>
    <li>Partner with your School of Education to bring more Computer Science
    into the Ed program - ideally a teaching-methods course, or any Computer
    Science Endorsement.</li>
    <li>Give support/instruction to the "tech ed" courses at local high
    schools.</li>
    <li>Help Code.org scale by offering K-5 workshops for us! email <a
    href="mailto:univ@code.org">univ@code.org</a> if interested. This idea is
    about 1.5 weeks old... but we still want you to write to us!</li>
</ul>

<h4>Anybody:</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Convince your local school district to teach CS. (Code.org will enter
    new regions if 30+ high schools are on board)</li>
    <li>Help us improve our curriculum (<a target="_blank"
    href="http://code.org/hints">Code.org/hints</a>). The Hour of code is
    behind us now, but we're still getting 1M students to the site every
    week!</li>
</ul>


<h3>Pillar #2 - Advocate</h3>

<p>
Computer Science is foundational! Every student should have access. Computer
Science should be core academic offering <strong>IN</strong> school not just a
vocational elective on the side. Code.org takes a broad approach. We make
recommendations for states to adopt. For further reading see <em><a
target="_blank" href="http://pathways.acm.org/ACM_pathways_report.pdf">The ACM
Report Rebooting Pathways to Success</a></em>.</p>

<p>At the National Level we have the <a target="_blank"
href="http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2536">Computer
Science Education Act</a>, which has bi-partisan sponsors in both houses. It
says more or less that STEM funding can be used for Computer Science. Highly
non-controversial bill. Small amount of optimism that it will be passed, but
since this is the most unproductive congress ever...
</p>

<p>At the State Level, we want schools to allow Computer Science to satisfy
existing high school Math/Science graduation requirements. At the University
Level we want to Make CS "Count." We want Computer Science to satisfy
Math/Science College admissions requirements. We need Universities to recognize
the above point.</p>

<strong>Where it counts!</strong>
<ul>
    <li>CS enrollment is 50% higher in states where it counts</li>
    <li>37% more participation by African American and Hispanic students</li>
    <li>Calculus enrollment remained unchanged</li>
    <li>We have legislation on deck for states like: FL, NY, IL, CA, AZ, OK
    OK</li>
    <li>We have policy recommendations in the works on a district level in
    states like: WA, KY, MI, CO, MA</li>
</ul>

<p>
We're going to start a collaborative whitepaper for Universities to accept
AP/IB Computer Science to satisfy Math/Science requirements.
</p>

<h3>Pillar #3 - Celebrate</h3>

<p>Hour of Code is a hard act to follow. Fastest web technology to reach 15
million users! It took <a target="_blank" href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> 3
years, and <a target="_blank" href="http://instagram.com">Instagram</a> 14
months. <strong>We did it in 5 days.</strong></p> 

<em><strong><blockquote>More girls participated in US schools in <a
target="_blank" href="http://csedweek.org">Computer Science Education Week</a>
in seven days, than the last 70 Years.</blockquote></strong></em>

<p><em>Huge applause from SIGCSE Audience</em></p>

<p>
The 2014 Computer Science Education Week is December 8-14th. Our goal is that
<em>100,000,000</em> students try The Hour of Code in 2014. It will
require participation by a majority of US students, Plus broad international
participation. You can help by asking your school to participate, and by buying
and wearing Code.org swag.</p>

<h3>Closing thoughts</h3>

<p>
Computer Science is at an incredible inflection point. There are people here
doing what I've been doing for 10 times longer. If you've tried before and
failed, try again. It wasn't <em>easy</em> to get the President to talk about
Computer Science, but it was easier than ever before. Leverage the numbers that
are now possible.</p>

<p><strong>With shared goals, anything is possible.</strong></p>

<h3>Q&A</h3>

<p>Q: I'm Celia from Montana Tech. Thank you for your efforts</p>
<p>A: Thank you!</p>

<p>
Q: I've been doing this since Seymore Papert taught me as an Undergrad years
ago. At Mt. Clair university, in NJ, about half the district is AA/Hispanic. We
have a performance gap, the school district brought in a new Superintendent,
obsessed with testing/new teacher evaluation. We brought in Code.org because of
you. 600 kids participated in two full double block sections of coding. Almost
100 kids district wide continue to do CS. They are learning Java, and they are
working on porting Flappy bird to processing.
</p>

<p>
A: I get asked "what can you learn in an hour?" Objectives are "its easy, fun,
and a 9 year old girl can do it!" One of our top complaints about our tutorials
is that "my students finished that over the weekend!"
</p>

<p>Q: I'd love to help out with K-5, what do you need from us?</p>

<p>
A: We just decided a week and a half ago we wanted to do this. We want to
provide curriculum/guidance, and enough materials to make it as easy as
possible. We want to do as much as we can to get it done. We can't fly
everywhere, so we want univ partnerships. Send us an email.
</p>

<p>
Q: When I talk to our administrators, when will it (K-5 Workshop) be ready?
Summer?
</p>

<p>
A: Probably fall, or winter. As others reach out to help, we can do more. We
move faster than most Education organizations for sure, but I can't say "this
summer" or else people will freak.
</p>

<p>
Q: I noticed in your advocacy, you had the current AP course. What about the
future one?
</p>

<p>
A: In Advocacy, we don't differentiate between current AP course and future
course. The politicians want to say "we did something to create jobs." We tie
it to AP cause it makes sense, but the law will work for the new and current AP
Computer Science course. We endorse the AP course, but we're not ourselves
doing things to pay to adopt AP course. We say "if you want to do more, here
are stipends." I don't believe it will go away, but I hope it moves to Python
or another language. Object inheritance was big before, but not is as big a
deal now.
</p>

<p>
Q: As a teacher in a former life, the engineers had "the egg drop." Finally we
have one too! Bravo.
</p>

<p>Q: I'm from Los Angeles unified, which was the #2 district not on your
list. We just unanimously approved to give 90 days to superintendent to find
out how to get more CS into curriculum.</p>

<p>
A: This is exactly the example of doing more on things that failed before.
</p>

<p>
Q: VA prof: I had a question about advocacy for admissions: Is there anyone
studying the effect of 3 years of math + 1 year of CS?
</p>

<p>
A: Not all states require 4 years of math, or all colleges. The only data I'm
aware of, is the question "Can Computer Science help kids learn math?" It is a
big deal. The only data I'm aware of is in Springfield PA, that has a
longitudinal dataset for an "all required to take CS" cohort of high school
students. The data will take 1-2 years to collect, but we'll do it.
</p>

<p>
Q: MA Community College prof: we ran an hour of code, had 230 students. I find
myself in the situation where STEM Director asks me advice about how to help
build a STEAM Kindergarten, and advice on using computers, but also where do
you put computing in middle or elementary school? I'm not familiar with how to
do Computer Science in K12. Should it go in Math, Science, English? I can't
answer. I would like to get some advice on other places that do this. High
schools, yes, but pre-K and elementary too.
</p>

<p>
A: Everyone is doing it different everywhere. Some Computer Science curriculum
is stand-alone, and every school is different. We are unprescriptive about
where the curriculum goes. We have this 20 hour course which is described as a
K-8 course, which is a wide-range of ability, but we want a early/middle/late
elementary course, which should make it much easier. These will be aligned to
Common Core standards as well.
</p>

<p>
Q: <!--So passionate about this am I, that I don't need a hat.--> Prof. from
Chicago. It's really good that the major public face of Code.org is youthful,
to attract younger kids to the field, and you did make reference to the fact
that many of us have been in the trenches working for a long time, facing lots
of challenges. There is a large force of faculty in this room, who are close to
retirement, and I think many of us are looking to the next phase of being CS
Educators without teaching everyday. I recommend marshalling those of us who
have the experience in a unified way.
</p>

<p>
A: we have a large mailing list, but we haven't used it in an organized way.
Last year we did it effectively for hour of code. We have too long a list of
things we can't do on our own, that we need volunteer help for. The same can be
said for retired software engineers, who want to help, but don't have the
experience you do.
</p>

<p>
Q: Have we thought about adding something called 'STEM Credit" where CS would
count, and you wouldn't get pushback from MATH/Science?
</p>

<p>
A: In my state of Washington, they categorize STEM separate from Math/Science.
We worry that if we don't put it in the core, it will end up orphaned.
</p>

<p>
Q: Prof. from SC. I was listening, and thinking, you're riding and amplifying a
wave of enthusiasm, or fashion, of computer science education, which is a huge
contribution. We've seen some of this before with the science gap in the late
50's and 60's. The fact is that Math/Science Education, 50 years after Sputnik,
still remains a major challenge. What can we learn from what didn't happen 50
years ago?
</p>

<p>
A: Tongue-in-cheek: If we can teach CS <em>just as badly</em> as Math/Science,
we'll be 10 times better off!</p>

<p><em>(audience has a good laugh)</em></p>

<p>I don't have data, but Studying Computer Science gives kids motivation to
learn Math/Science. I believe that most kids are like "what am I going to do
with these equations in real-life?" The "getting a job" part I believe is
enough.

    <blockquote>
    After his keynote address, Hadi generously obliged the author with a
    one-on-one follow-up interview. Below are his responses.

</em>


<h4>Q: Where are you From?</h4>
<p>I'm Originally form Tehran, Iran, and now from <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.ci.bellevue.wa.us/">Bellevue Washington.</a>
 <a target="_blank" href="https://code.org">Code.org</a> is based in Seattle,
WA.
</p>

<h4>Q: Where did you Study?</h4>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://harvard.edu">Harvard</a> Grad, BS/MS in <a
target="_blank" href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science">Computer
Science</a>, 1994</p>

<h4>Q: Any clubs/activities outside of school?</h4>
<p>Our Computer Programming Team, took 7th in the world in the <a
target="_blank"
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest">ACM
International Collegiate Programming Competition</a> my senior year.</p>

<h4>Q: Why did you start Code.org?</h4>
<p>I think the fundamental reason, is it should happen. Anyone who tries
CS/Programming, a lightbulb goes on. It teaches creativity and it is
<em>powerful</em>. It seems un-American that 90% of schools don't offer
Computer Science. I'm living the dream, sure, but it is a dream that 90% of
kids won't have access to.</p>

<p>Fewer schools teach Computer Science <strong>NOW</strong> than 10 years ago.
This lack of Computer Science is breaking the American Dream.</p>

<p>The very seed of Code.org was a technology Roundtable in December of 2011
with President Obama. As I was listening to myself speak, I thought "no one is
going to do something about this..." In March of 2012, I was at a conference
with <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jack">Jack Dorsey</a> and <a
target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/drewhouston">Drew Houston</a>. I
talked about making a video, which started as a hobby idea, but as soon as they
said "yes" I've been on a path that hasn't relented since.</p>

<h4>Q: What are your thoughts on Free/Open Source Software?</h4>

<p>
Personally I firmly believe that education should be as Free and Open as
possible. The intellectual property around education should be both free, and
Open Source. All the curriculum we create will be licensed <a target="_blank"
href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>, and all the code Open
Source. We want the community and volunteers to help us. We get asked all the
time "can you do this? Can you do that?" and the best answer is "Here is the
source code, go ahead and <strong>DO</strong> it."
</p>

<p>
We've made tutorials where we have Angry Birds and pigs, and countries tell us
that that is a religious issue. When it is Open Source, we tell them to change
it, and they can.
</p>

<p>
We have prisons that want to use our stuff, but can't have internet, so we WANT
them to adapt offline versions of our code.
</p>

<p>
Those are things that we didn't even imagine when we started, and can happen
through Open Source.
</p>

<h4>Q: Final Thoughts?</h4>

<p>
Even if you are not an engineer, it takes five minutes to see how fun the
tutorials are. Even as an adult, you can learn to code too!
</p>

<p>
If you want to get involved, <a target="_blank"

who want to help us.
