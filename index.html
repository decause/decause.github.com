<p>This post is in response to the article <em>"The Hacker Hacked"</em> by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/suitpossum">Brett Scott</a>: </p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/how-yuppies-hacked-the-original-hacker-ethos/">http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/how-yuppies-hacked-the-original-hacker-ethos/</a></h4>


<blockquote>
"In this context, the hacker ethic is hollowed out and subsumed into the ideology of solutionism, to use a term coined by the Belarusian-born tech critic Evgeny Morozov. It describes the tech-industry vision of the world as a series of problems waiting for (profitable) solutions."
</blockquote>

<p>
I have mixed feels about this one. Brett's article is a good one, and has some key pieces of history, and proper shout-outs to the giants who's shoulders we stand on. Props Brett. I, however, think I'm just super biased and jaded, and all like <em>"uh, yeah, obvs, duh."</em> I'm a Hackademic, and perhaps a lil bit <em>too</em> familiar with much of this. At the same time, I'm <strong>*very*</strong> excited for the mainstreaming of hackery, and defanging the old "ski mask" tropes about hackers. I don't see this as a bad thing, or a risk, because of the fail-safe (we hope) of transparency. When SV startups think they are "disrupting" or "saving the world" by creating yet-another-shitty-app, they are going to get the "validation" they deserve when no one buys their product or contributes to their community. From what I can tell, Hackers don't want to solve other people's problems that don't need solving, they want to make progress.
</p>

<p>
I think we're seeing a super influx of <em>/potential/</em> legit hackers, and as much as I love a good retelling of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Mel">the story of Mel</a> as the next guy, the old-guard elitism needs to leave room for the next gen to learn, even if they are starting from a softer more sterile place than the copper-age hackers did. I think that the thing that makes a hacker a hacker is that curiosity, to see how far the rabbit hole really goes, and to be unafraid to trace a thread all the way down the stack to see where it starts. Everyone has to start somewhere, and with the right exposure, even the "yuppiest" of webdevs can find their way to the core of empowerment. The transformation happens not because of the movies, or job prospects, or gadgets, but because of the <em>autonomy</em>. Learning to solve your own problems is a compounding virtuous cycle that ultimately causes you to question every other cycle not focused on rapid iterative improvement. You can get into that cycle whether you are building shitty-apps, or world changing FOSS code, the <em>production process</em> requires openness, and honesty. The important things are that the infrastructure remain neutral, and that copyleft licensing remain the standard.
</p>

<p>
We'll look back on IP policy of today the same way that the people who used looms to create textiles look back on hand-stitching, or the way that proponents of the locomotive regarded critics who said that speeds above 30 MPH would cause bodily harm. These machines and processes too, were at a time, a threat to the status quo, and subversive, and unnatural, and, and, and... but at some point they became the new standard, which is the era I reckon we are approaching--exemplified by recent developments like the Open Sourcing of certain closely held programming languages and environments, and bottom-line concerned organizations like Wal-mart and Capital One embracing open development practices, and even contributing back upstream in some cases. "Gentrification" and "appropriation" are great <strike>sensationalization</strike> SEO words, but words like "synthesis", and "merge commit" are more what comes to my mind when talking about the mainstreaming of hacking. Perhaps I'm not being romantic enough?
</p>

<p>
I'm not afraid that all the "real"* hackers are going to be displaced or that there is no longer a place for merry pranksters. When the source is open, and the platform accessible, and the pipes neutral, and the power transparent, tricking someone into doing something against their own interests is much more difficult. When resources are not allocated in an optimal fashion, it can be made clear, and whether you a suit or a rabble-rouser, waste is in no one's best interests.
</p>

<p>

It's finally done, and I've half-way caught up on all the sleep I didn't get during the past week ;) I had a ball seeing all you Fedorans strolling around my regular haunts, and cannot wait to see you all again soon. May your travels home be safe and expedient!</p>

<p>Please be patient with me for the next day or so as catch up on my inbox and all the administrivia and loop-closing that comes along with hosting a conference in your hometown. Once that is taken care of, I'll be spinning up a proper recap and redux blog post for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flocktofedora.org">FLOCK 2015</a> (aka FLOCKchester).

</figure><p>Since I got here, I've been doing my best to create a mental map of all the
<em>parts</em> of Fedora. From what I've gathered thusfar, there are <a target="_blank" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Overview">13</a>
subprojects (See: wiki sidebar), along with a number of web properties, and a
slew of upstream communities that Fedorans are tapped into. But even after
getting the broadest sense of how many moving parts there are, that still
doesn't explain <em>HOW</em>, only who. I've said to myself "Gee whiz, if
only there were a list of all the things that needed to be done to ship a
release..." Today, thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Jzb">jzb</a>, I have found the
<strong>HOLY GRAIL</strong> of "how a Fedora becomes a release" and I'm here to
share it with you too!</p>

<blockquote>
    While at OSCON 2015 I watched a presentation that I felt was trollish and
    flamebaity--stoking the fires of FOSS Holy war just for the sake of
    stirring up controversy. This opinion, though expressed by a well-known
    organizational leader, I felt lacked legal and business acumen, and
    presented a very flat and trite reasoning for forgoing copyleft licenses. I
    have heard legitimate arguments--and I will continue to be a license
    pluralist--but all of them were stronger than "here is a kitten. You can't
    argue with a kitten."

    Even the "strongest" arguments I heard "There are now foundations to
    steward FOSS projects" which is at worst, a stunningly glorious conflict of
    interest, and at best, not taking into account the legal and policy
    realities of a post-citizen's united IRS, who started issuing BOLOs for
    applicants using the term "Open Source" in 2010: via EFF
    (https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/open-source-madness), source here:
    http://democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/sites/democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/files/November%202010%20BOLO%20IRS0000001349-IRS0000001364.pdf

    I could continue, but this isn't even going to show up in the copy so I'll
    get back to attempting to be brief...

</figure><p>I am a license pluralist. I think Author and contributor choice of
distribution is important, and we need to have as diverse a toolbox of legal
instruments as possible, to fit as varied a field of softwares as we can
conceive.</p>

<p><strong>But</strong></p>

<p>
The "Freedom to close" is not a freedom. 
</p>
<p>
The "Freedom to exploit" is not a freedom.
</p>

If someone said "I'd love to help you write a book, so long as I can take the
manuscript and publish it on my own at any time, without giving you credit or
compensation," would you be all like "that sounds someone who has
<em><strong>MY</strong></em> best interests at heart!"
-->

<p>
Your organization not adopting copyleft software, is not a failing of copyleft,
it is a failing of your organization to participate <em>authentically</em> in
an Open ecosystem of innovation. It is your organization saying <em>"I want to
keep my options open, in case there is ever a time when it would be convenient
to cut you out of the equation."</em>
</p>

<p>
Folks might say "Yeah, that is what doing business at arm's length is!" or "By
nature, people are greedy and/or selfish!"
</p>

<p>
And that is exactly why we have contracts and licenses! We use them all the
time in non-copyleft contexts to ensure that both parties hold up their end of
a clearly defined agreement.
</p>

<p>
So why-oh-why is there some sort of <strong><em>virtue</em></strong> in
entering into an agreement that would allow the other party to renege? The
freedom to break a social or business contract whenever it is convenient,
implies that you think you can outmanoeuvre the other party, and that your
strategy's real strength is subterfuge, not what you bring to the table.
</p>

<p>
That is not what genuine collaboration is. It is an okey doke, and contributors
are falling for it left and right against their own interests.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ant_and_the_Grasshopper

Did the Little Red Hen let any of the animals who didn't do the work eat the
bread? 

(Well, really this is a parable about free riders and coattailing, which
doesn't lend itself quite as well to FOSS, because those things actually
generate value when done properly. If bread didn't take any* material inputs,
and the feedback of the animals about the bread could be utilized to make
future iterations better...)

*: any meaning material inputs that have a marginal reproduction cost that
asymptotically approaches zero

You can ad hominem RMS all you'd like.

You can point to the historically counter-culture of position of copyleft in
the FOSS Movement; but Copyleft *is* the strongest protection for your IP, and
though it is not more popular than copyright, it is mainstream now.

There *are* times when using the GPL is inadvisable. I have heard only
<em>ONE</em> business case for a security and exploit aggregation framework
that collects all the holes in your system. Someone could make a request for
your source under the GPL (in theory) to get a list of all those holes. The
project choose to permissively license the data file definitions and
configuration files that describe the security holes. That is the only viable
use-case I have ever heard. I'm *constantly* looking for others.

<p>The idea is, take an RSS feed, or a list of RSS feeds, and generate a
word_cloud for each feed, and the aggregate content from all the feeds, like
so: <br><br><code>python gencloud.py config.json</code><br><br>with config files that look
like this:
</p>
<pre>
{
    "feeds": [
        "http://blog-decause.rhcloud.com/rss.xml",
        "http://nathanielca.se/feeds/all.atom.xml"
    ],
    "mask_filename": "fossboxlogo-mono.png",
    "output_dir": "feedcloud",
    "output_image": "feedcloud.png",
    "stop_words": ["http", "https"],
    "each_corpi": true,
    "max_words": 1000
}
</pre> 
<strong>Merits</strong>:
    <ol>
<li>Individual word_clouds for each rss feed AND the aggregate cloud of all posts combined!</li>
        <li>Uses a config file written in json for easy parsing</li>
        <li>Once it is set up, it is very easy to create multiple configurations to create many visualizations with ease.</li>
        <li>easy to use blacklist within config file for easy tweaking.</li>
    </ol>
<p><strong>Demerits</strong>:
    </p>
<ol>
<li>word_cloud is a very powerful, but also very <strong>heavy-weight</strong> stack to stand up and run. After many attempts, I finally got my first virtualenv working, and I've been using the same one ever since in all my word_cloud related projects :/</li>
    </ol>
<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/decause/wordcloudbot">wordcloudbot</a></h3>
<p>Arguably the most complete of the tools in the box, it builds upon the work of <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/decause/feedcloud">feedcloud</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/amueller/word_cloud">word_cloud</a> to deliver fancy wordcloud visualizations via Twitter each time an IRC meeting ends and sends the logs message across the fedmsg bus! This tool is "deployed" on my machine locally as a systemd service, but will hopefully be deployed to Fedora Infrastructure in the near-ish future (packaging the word_cloud stack for Fedora is low on the priority totem pole for me personally, but def a goal I'd like to deliver on in the next 120 days (but probably not the next 30/60/90.) You can glance the fruits of wordcloudbot's cycles on the <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/fedobot">Fedobot</a> twitter account.</p>


<h3><a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/ralphbean/fedora-stats-tools">fedora-stats-tools</a></h3> 
<p>fedora-stats-tools is a breeding ground for interesting one-off scripts and tools. It is the default place where various CommOps experiments are being pushed to, before they end up in their own repositories. Here is what we've got in there so far:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ralph&gt;ean/fedora-stats-tools/blob/develop/annualgrepper.py">annualgrepper</a></h4>
<p>This is a very basic script that uses the <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">requests</a> library to get the raw json for fedmsgs over the past year, and pulls out the final field of that raw json response, which includes a total number of messages.</p>
    <h4><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ralphbean/fedora-stats-tools/blob/develop/meetbot-fedmsg-activity.py">meetbot-fedmsg-activity</a></h4>
    <p>A jinja2 template that creates links to meetbot activities for each subproject. This is an "artisinal" solution we're using to aggregate datagrepper information prior to the completion of hubs. The challenge is to *not* engineer something, but write as light-weight of a tool as possible to give us raw data. There is also a cronjob running locally on threebean infrastructure to send me a daily reminder to compile the stats from the information gathered by this template.</p>
    <h4><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ralphbean/fedora-stats-tools/blob/develop/daily-briefing.py">daily-briefing</a></h4>
    <p>A descendant of meetbot-fedmsg-activity, this jinja2 template takes lists of URLs, if they are not empty, and generates a "daily briefing" with things like action items and links generated by meetings and captured by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fedora-infra/supybot-fedora">zodbot</a>. Ideally, these lists will be compiled by using BeautifulSoup in the near future, so that every day, the briefing can be shipped without human interaction (and perhaps tweeted by fedobot, but that is another project for another time.)</p>
</ul>
<h3>Long-tail</h3>
<p>This particular tool and its purposes was covered at length already in a previous post: <a target="_blank" href="http://decausemaker.org/posts/grokkingfedmsg.html">http://decausemaker.org/posts/grokkingfedmsg.html</a></p>


<h2>Why a toolbox?</h2>
<p>Well, I wanted to include a bit of this in my last post, but for now, here is the gist: The position of Fedora Community Lead has not existed before I had the privilege of filling the slot. There are *many* duties and responsibilities, defined by many stakeholders, and right now, I'm a one-man army looking to deliver on each of them. "Linus does not scale" and neither does decause. I'm working on making each of my contributions "autonomous" so that they do not block on a single person, and can invest the labor needed to deliver on these metrics <strong>once</strong>, and the deploy/redeploy multiple times as needed. It has been somewhat slow going, but it is my hope that each of these tools can help each problem space or bucket within the CommOps ecosystem of initiatives (see: <a target="_blank" href="http://decausemaker.org/posts/proposal-commops-for-fedora.html">http://decausemaker.org/posts/proposal-commops-for-fedora.html</a> for the full proposal, and/or contribute your thoughts on the wiki here, <a target="_blank" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/CommOps">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/CommOps)</a></p>

<h2>Halp!</h2>
<p>Metrics is where we've started. It has been a small core of folks working, but the <strong><em>spirit</em></strong> of the Community Operations team should start to become more clear as these types of tools get built. I'm still learning my way around this <strong>massive</strong> community of FOSS hackers that is Fedora. I still don't know where all of the corners are, or who all the people that make each of those legs gallop with the whole are, but I sure want to. Someday (150ish days from now) there will be <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/ralphbean/fedora-hubs/prototype">FedoraHubs</a>, which is really the ultimate manifestation and incarnation of Community from the amazingly-sleek-and-powerful real-time infrastructure that is powered by the fedmsg ecosystem, but until then, things are going to have to be a bit more manual until we can get there. If you'd like to help tell the story of your particular corner of Fedora, or would like to help provide the <em>"10,000 foot view"</em> on the project's contributor base, then by all means please reach out in IRC (#fedora-apps on freenode) and let me know. I'm here to help, but I sure could use some too :)</p>

After upgrading to <a target="_blank" href="https://fedoraproject.org">Fedora22</a> last week, I've had to sand down a few rough corners. One of them which has cropped up was that some of the tracks on <a target="_blank" href="http://soundcloud.com">Soundcloud</a> just would not play while I was in <a target="_blank" href="https://mozilla.org/firefox">Firefox</a>. I thought it was likely because user-generated content is often prone to take-downs, spurious or not, and just kinda shrugged it off. But after trying to play a few particularly popular tracks from confirmed accounts, I decided something must be amiss. I popped open the code inspector, enabled the console, and right off the bat was greeted with a clever recruiting message from Soundcloud:
</p>

<blockquote>
    "You like to look under the hood? Why not help us build the engine? http://soundcloud.com/jobs"
</blockquote>

<p>Thereafter, I would get <code>"Media resource could not be decoded"</code> error messages followed by long strings representing the tracks.</p>

<p>
Through some search-engine-foo, I was able to dig up this ticket: <a target="_blank" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=964032">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=964032</a>.
In it, it is explained that there was likely an issue with codecs not being
installed, with Ubuntu specific instructions. After originally enabling the RPM
Fusion repos, I was able to search for and install
<code>gstreamer1-libav</code> codec, restart Firefox, and play the broken tracks.

<p>This is one of the things that we hired Remy D to work on</p>

<p>Hi there <a href="r/linux" rel="nofollow">/r/linux</a>!</p>

<p>This is a great question, and one that members of the Fedora-Infra team
have spent the past year building tools and gathering data to answer. The <a href="http://www.fedmsg.com/en/latest/" rel="nofollow">fedmsg</a> project,
along with tools like <a href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/datagrepper/" rel="nofollow">datagrepper</a>, have been collecting stats on developer and
community contributions within Fedora, and feeding those stats into <a href="https://badges.fedoraproject.org/" rel="nofollow">Fedora Badges</a> to
quantify, recognize, and promote activity. Everything from git commits, wiki
edits, IRC meetings, blog posts, package builds (and fails), conference/event
participation, all kinds of public activity is being published in
<em>real-time</em> on the fedmsg bus! I even have a <a href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/fedmsg-notify" rel="nofollow">GNOME Shell extension</a> installed pops-up desktop
notifications whenever messages related to my favorite hackers or packages go
over the wire :)</p>

<p>From this fire-hose of data we can surface correlations between types of
messages, and message patterns as they relate to specific phases of the
release cycle (or other timelines for that matter) to make informed decisions
of how best to prioritize and publicize action.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where do new contributors come from?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm pretty new to this role in Fedora, but I've been studying and
organizing FOSS communities as a Hackademic for some time now. Here is my
(wholly unoriginal) take on this: It starts with the task, then the people,
then the idea. </p>

<p>This model for organizational development doesn't just play out in FOSS,
but in all types of communities of practice. At first you show up because you
need to accomplish something. You have an itch to scratch. In the case of a
work-for-hire relationship, that itch may be "I need to pay my bills," but in
FOSS it is usually, "I need a tool to do a task," paid or not.</p>

<p>You start there, maybe from scratch, or more likely by taking something
that works and adjusting it to fit your use-case, with help from people who
came before you. Those who helped you are likely people solving problems you
are interested in solving, and the more you work together, the faster you can
complete the tasks you set out to accomplish. You help them, they help you,
and the virtuous cycle is off and running :)</p>

<p>Once you've established a working relationship with the people, you are now
part of something larger. That larger something--whether it is a company, or a
hackerspace, or a common goal or cause or idea--is the thing that eventually
motivates you to stay and continue contributing.</p>

<p>New contributors come for the task, but stay for the community.</p>

<p>Our problem is there is so much more work than there is people who can do
that work. New contributors don't emerge from the womb ready to start hacking.
We (Fedora and FOSS-at-large) must support and cultivate an entirely new
base.</p>

<p>I've helped a decent amount of new contributors get started through my work
at RIT, which has mostly been about equipping them with tools in their
toolbelt to do certain tasks. Once a new contributor feels the empowerment
that comes from solving their own problems, they usually find their way to
people and places where those types of  problems are getting solved, FLOSSophy
or not.</p>

<p>From what I've seen, new contributors come not just from working with the
best tools for the job, but from having a positive place to experiment and
learn (and teach!) about using them.</p>
