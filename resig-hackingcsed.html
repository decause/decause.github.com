</em>

<p>
I'm deeply honored to be here today. I keep coming back to RIT, every couple of
years, and I live in NYC now. There are always new buildings and new things
happening. Very fantastic.
</p>

<p>
I'm here to talk about the stuff I'm doing with <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>. I'm the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/about/the-team">"Dean of
computer science"</a> which is really a very tongue-in-cheek thing, since we
can make up our titles.
</p>

<p>
I guess, I'd start with an intro to what Khan Academy is, and dig deeper into
what I'm doing with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/cs">CS
platform</a> in particular.
</p>

<p>
I joined in Khan Academy in 2011, after I worked at <a target="_blank"
href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> doing JavaScript tool development.
</p>

<p>
The big thing, our goal, is <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.khanacademy.org/about">"Bring World-Class Education to
Everyone, Everywhere for free."</a>
</p>

<p>
We are <strong>really</strong> good at producing educational material. Our Math,
Science, Computer Science and Art History are very good. Most content is
released under a <a target="_blank" href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative
Commons</a> license, so you can take it and do what you want with it.
</p>


<p>
We're making inroads to bring our content to the world. I've been Working on
the Internationalization of Khan Academy. There are some problems in CS, that
are "solved problems," and you'd think doing a website in multiple languages
would have been one of these... but it is <strong>hard</strong>. So many
edge-cases...
</p>

<p>
We have videos, articles, exercises, all things relating to our curriculum.
Who here uses Khan Academy Math curriculum as a supplement?
</p>

<blockquote>
    <em>many people raise hands</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
That's pretty good! We usually tend to skew younger than college age!
</p>

<p>
One of the things we do is track all the work you're doing, so you can get a
more effective education. Every exercise and video, we track when you did it,
and how it went. If you got right answers, or wrong answers. We can figure out
why you're getting it wrong, and how to make it better. We have a dashboard,
where we can push you to work on exercises to move your knowledge forward.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/Khan/khan-exercises">This was the first thing</a>
I built at Khan Academy, this framework for easily
creating exercises. This is a system where you have a problem, charts, hints,
and when you answer stuff, it can steer you when you get things wrong, to give
you a better understanding. I worked on the internationalization for this as
well, and it was ridiculously hard. Exercises made a lot of assumptions about
English, and western ways of doing this.
</p>

<p>
Take "Jane gives one ball to Fred," for example.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's easy, we'll just replace the words!" But every language has
differing ideas of what is singular and what is plural. Some places have more
or less rules, and even separate rules if the number ends with a three! We are
now available in Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.
</p>

<p>
Much of our Material on the site is split into a tutorial format. This is where
you can go through, watch videos, do exercises, very linear form. This is great
for our math content, and you see many students at middle-school and
grade-school level using this. As I said before, we're tracking lots of data to
give students a better experience, but also, the teachers.
</p>

<p>
Khan Academy is trying to change how we think about education. So we can
provide teachers with insights on how students are understanding content, and
progressing. You can see how they are struggling.
</p>

<p>
We want to change the "traditional" model--you go in, and the teacher gives a
lecture to students about a material, and assumes that everyone is at the same
level. It assumes everyone has equal footing, and often, this is not the case.
You have students lagging, and students who are <strong>wayyyy</strong> ahead.
If we had better data, teachers could make more informed decisions.
</p>

<h3>
We break it down for the teacher so they can track specifically what students
are working on at a given time, and analyze students in a class, or across
classes. No longer do they need to give a general lecture. Now it's "ok, it's
math time. You set <strong>YOUR</strong> goals."
</h3>

<p>
This week, a student decides they want to finish long division. They can work
on that, and watch videos. The teacher can track whether they are getting
stuck, and then give a targeted lecture. If there are four students struggling
with long division, the teacher can give those four a lecture to reinforce
those concepts, rather than doing the same thing <strong>over and over
again</strong> with the entire class. This means they have time to do more
one-to-one teaching. They can see who has higher or lower levels of
understanding. This is something that provides a huge level of insight to
teachers, to better use their time.
</p>

<p>
We have lots of students using this system now; Over <em>3 million problems per
day</em>. There are huge spikes in the beginning of school in September--we
hit <em>10 million active students</em>. I'd like to teach on a classroom
basis, sure, but this is a way that I can better expand and stretch myself to
teach computer science content. Depending how you measure, we have <strong>250,000 to 1
million students</strong> doing Computer Science stuff on the site.</p>

<h2>Khan Academy Computer Science</h2>

<!--No visual :(
<p>
That is what I wanted to show you today. This is my baby.
</p>
-->

<p>
I started working on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/cs">CS
platform</a> late 2011, and released August 2012. We iterated a
number of times, and settled on this final implementation. The big thing here,
this is on the CS part of the website. We have a lot of curriculum. My coworker,
<a href="http://www.pamelafox.org/" target="_blank">Pamela Fox</a>,
is producing all the content (videos exercises, etc...).
</p>

<p>
We go up to object oriented techniques, not much overlap with CS 101, and we have a long way
to go to be a "full" cs curriculum. You probably won't be able to go out from
here and get a job yet. I want to encourage people, expecially at the target of
middle-school and up, in finding the thing that excites them most about
programming, and applying it to their life.
</p>

<h3>
Showing people the ways that programming can help improve science, biology, or
art. <strong>I'd love it if our Computer Science platform didn't jut produce
Computer Science students, but enabled students to do what they love, with
programming to help them do it well</strong>. Art historians who can program.
Humanities people who can code. Cross-pollination, for disciplines that
traditionally don't overlap. This is hard, but this is what I'd like to see.
</h3>

<p>
Who is familiar with <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>?
</p>

<em>
    <blockquote>
        many hands raise
    </blockquote>
</em>

<p>
You can edit code, fork it, upload it, and make changes to the original.
Similarly, what we have on Khan Academy, is the ability to make programs. Has
anyone heard of Flappy Bird? <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/flappy-bird/5241613641056256">Someone
rewrote this within Khan Academy</a>!
</p>


<p>
We don't allow outside images yet, so anything you can see here on the CS site,
is <em>drawn</em>.
</p>


<p>
So someone made this game, a student I don't know. It got 700+
votes so far, and 1600+ "forks," which we call spin-offs. These are all
variations on what has been made. It looks like most of them are about the
same. Slight changes in the color of Flappy bird, stuff like that. Students are
taking the code and modifying it. This program has already had over
<strong>1000</strong> spin-offs, or, programs which were cloned or modified in
some way. The top spin-off itself has <strong>113</strong> votes, and over
<strong>100</strong> of it's own spin-offs! This is a very different
collaborative environment. People making something, and learning from it.
</p>

<h3>
I wanted to build off of the Open Source Model. I wanted the code to be the
front and center, and not just show the graphical content, even when it is not
a programming exercise.
</h3>

<p>
We have a partnership with <a target="_blank" href="http://nasa.gov">NASA</a>,
and we're doing lots of simulation stuff. One is making a lander go into orbit
and land. It is really hard. Though it isn't required, I wanted to show the
code. People who are interested in space can look at the simulation, see it,
and say "hey, how does this work? How can I learn more?"
</p>

<p>
I can go in and modify the simulation, and save it as my own spin-off, and make
whatever changes I want. That is the model we've embraced here.
</p>

<p>
Stuff like <a target="_blank" href="https://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a>, and
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cuttherope.net/">Cut The Rope</a> style
games; those are always popular here. Someone made a drawing program. You can't
really save "state," so in the program, at the end, it spits out a giant blob
of text, which is what you can copy-and-paste into a program to recreate your
drawing!</p>

<h3>
Students have found ways to work around our system. This type of "meta"
programming and activity is what it is <strong><em>all</em></strong> about.
</h3>

<p>
Students are even making clubs now. They will hang out and chat with each other
in the comments section. Social groups are forming.
</p>

<p>
Students also tend to make lots of demands, and often petition for lots of
things. Usually you'll find one at the top of just about every page. One
thing often requested is support for playing sound, which I suspect students
will abuse plenty...
</p>

<blockquote><em>*audience has a good laugh*</em></blockquote>


<!--
<p>
I wanted to show you a little bit of the environment here, and show you how it
works.
</p>

<p>
This is a blank program. In this program, we give them documentation. It is
based on <a target="_blank" href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>, which
is a language created at <a target="_blank" href="http://mit.edu">MIT</a>, and
it is used extensively to make graphical things, but has been expanded to do
3D, and stuff with the Kinect, and sound. We're using <a target="_blank"
href="http://processingjs.org/">Processing.js</a>, which I wrote back in 2008,
and ported to JavaScript.
</p>

<h3>
I wanted to replicate this environment. I wanted to make the process of
learning more intuitive. The normal feedback loop that exists when you
programming. Typically, expecially with compiled languages, you save code, run
it, wait, and then debug, and see if it actually worked. It would be more
rewarding if you could see an immediate response. Part of that, is having the
code exist, right next to the graphical output. There is no compilation step.
</h3>

<p>
We have the ability now, with things like number-scrubbers, where you can see
the result of changing the numbers in real-time. Even if you know nothing
about what the arguments mean, you can mentally reverse engineer what is
happening underneath. "If I make this number bigger, it moves the location of
the rectangle."</p>
-->

<p>
I like when students can discover things for themselves. What they learn from
it tends to be much more deeply embedded. They take more pride in it.
</p>

<!--
<p>
This is all and good for a static program, but when you start to do more
dynamic programs like animation, how do you manipulate state in real-time? One
of the things you can do in Processing, you can have a draw loop, and you can
have the draw function called as quickly as possible, and draw again and again
and again. Nothing interesting is happening with the square, but add some
loops, and now you've got animation.
</p>


<p>
We have a color picker, so you don't have to remember all the RGB values
yourself. We have variables that hook into functions, that update state every
time the functions are called. One of the interesting things here, what happens
if we want to update one of these things? We can do that, and the program
continues to run. It is annoying to stop the program, and recompile, and
restart. You don't have to do that now.
</p>
-->


<p>
This has been my baby, real-time injection of JavaScript code, so you can
inject state into live running code. I feel like it is worth it. You get a much
more compelling experience, and you can manipulate things AS THEY HAPPEN. You
don't have to wait for program to restart. Even as we were typing in the code,
the program was still running! It works pretty well.
</p>


<!--
<p>
Another thing I wanted to show
</p>
-->


<p>
We can record all the actions, and keystrokes, and things being said. We can
play back commands and audio. We use videos frequently, but I don't think they
are great for computer programming. The thing you want students to do is take
some code, pause it, and change things to figure it out for themselves.
</p>

<p>
We had some really janky solutions where we would pause YouTube videos, and
regenerate code, but we got to this point. Now, you can pause, make a change,
and then when you hit play, it reverts the code, and continues from where you
left off.
</p>

<p>
We also have interactive transcripts now too, so that if you are hard of
hearing, or you want the transcript for what has been said, you can get it. And
we are now starting to translate those into other languages too (we're working
on translating the audio.)
</p>

<p>
All the ability to do this stuff is powered by browser technology, like <a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a>. We pull
content from  <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon
S3</a>, and it works surprisingly well.
</p>


<p>
I showed you math exercises, where a student is given a math problem, they put
in an answer, and then they get a "right or wrong" result. That works OK for
math, but not really for programming. What works well for learning program is
actually writing code. I want the students to be writing out the code. This is
one step above recordings. We are basically showing you what code to write, and
based on that, they can turn it into their own thing. There are much more
complicated programs that can be made from the basics.
</p>

<p>
One thing I'll mention is that a lot of code is Open Source, and available on
GitHub. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Khan">If you are interested
in contributing back, that is all there.</a>
</p>


<p>
We built a framework this summer called <a target="_blank"
href="http://khan.github.io/structuredjs">Structured.js</a>. We think it's
really cool. You can define a rough structure for the code you want students to
write, and then analyze the code to see if it matches a structure. We parse the
student code, convert into a syntax tree, and compare it to our syntax tree.
</p>

<p>
We use jQuery on the front-end, along with <a target="_blank"
href="http://backbonejs.org/">backbone.js</a>, and <a target="_blank"
href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">a new framework from Facebook called
react</a>. It is pretty crazy, and I think you should check it out.
I'm slowly getting used to it.
</p>

<p>
On the back-end, we use <a target="_blank" href="http://python.org">Python</a>
on <a target="_blank"
href="https://cloud.google.com/products/app-engine/">Google's App Engine</a>.
Sometimes we get on <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.cbsnews.com/60-minutes/">60 Minutes</a>, and the traffic goes
bonkers for an hour or two, then goes back down. Google App Engine handles it
quite well.</p>

<p>
I think I will wrap up there, and answer any questions anyone might have.
Questions about what I'm doing at Khan Academy, questions about <a
target="_blank" href="http://jquery.org">jQuery</a> of course. 
</p>

<blockquote>
    <em>
        audience laughter.
    </em>
</blockquote>

<h1>Q &amp; A</h1>

<p>Q: Does the order in which things are written matter in Structured.js?</p>

<p>
A: in this specific case here, it is forcing you to do your 'if' statement
before the loop, so yes.
</p>

<p>
A tool like this could be used poorly, sure. And that is why we have such
detailed hints. We provide the structure itself as a hint.
</p>

<p>
This is something here, that is one step above a video. They can name their
variables whatever they want, we don't care, which is an improvement from most
systems like this.
</p>

<p>
This is relatively new, but students love it, and they are using it a lot.
</p>

<p>
Q: You are doing this teaching in the browser, which is good, but are there any
"where to go next?" resources on Khan Academy?
</p>

<p>
A: We have an article called <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/programming/good-practices/a/what-to-learn-next">"what
to learn next"</a> where we direct students to tutorials and articles, projects
to work on, web development in general, and other language resources. At this
point, we are not everything for everyone, but we want to be the launching pad.
Here is your first taste, and then you push off from there.
</p>


<p>
Q: The structure was all S3 and Google App Engine?
</p>

<p>
A: Yes, all cloud hosted. S3 for file hosting, videos typically pulled from
<a target="_blank" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a>. We don't have any
physical servers. That is the nice thing about being "in the future" now, we
don't need any of that.
</p>

<blockquote>
    <em>
        Audience laughter.
    </em>
</blockquote>

<p>
Q: What is the history of the name?
</p>

<p>
A: It was created by <a target="_blank"
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Khan_%28educator%29">Salman
Khan</a>. He created many of the videos on the site. We also have other
professors and professionals who produce content, but he has done most of it.
It started as his <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.youtube.com/user/khanacademy">YouTube
channel</a>, to help his cousin learn math. It got bigger and bigger, until
it's it got up to like a million people.
</p>

<!--Too Technical. If you're technically inclined, you can view the source
here, and will appreciate this easter egg of sorts ;)
<p>
Q: When you're doing real-time injection, and you have a draw function, and a
draw person function, and you call draw person, what happens if you change the
draw person function?
</p>

<p>
A: It updates. What happens, in the nitty-gritty, let me roughly... it takes
that function, compiles it, and passes it into the running instance. The draw
function is using, what is the concept of a closure, which points back to the
draw person variable. It updates draw person with the new function. It points
back to the function itself. We reserialize the functions, and inject them back
in. All the "bad" features of JavaScript--we use Lots of eval, lots of
with statements.
</p>
-->


<p>
Q: How do you moderate all the content? There could be potentially negative
things, right?
</p>

<p>
A: We have a system for people to "flag" content, which puts it into a
moderators queue. Once it gets three flags, it gets automatically moderated,
and then can be reapproved by a moderator. We haven't had anything too terrible
show up yet. It's been running since 2012. Really, it's not the programs, as
much as the comments... BIG SURPRISE!</p>

<blockquote>
    <em>
        Audience Laughter
    </em>
</blockquote>


<p>
There have been "factions" of middle-school students who battle
in the comments sections. We were worried in the beginning, but this hasn't
actually happened yet. We banned outside images, and only allow images that we
provide. We had a student write a program that turns an image into a
multi-lined call to the rectangle function to recreate it. If we find a way to
ban something, students will always find a way around it. They are mostly doing
things like putting up pictures of their favorite Pokémon.
</p>

<h3>If we find a way to ban something, students will always find a way around
it.</h3>

<p>Q: Biggest tech challenge at Khan Academy?</p>

<p>
A: The real-time stuff was pretty huge. The internationalization stuff of the
past year was really hard, but hard in a different way. Not hard in the "how do
we scale" way, but in the "understanding the cross-cultural issues" way. One of
the hard problems for his platform, was making it in such a way that young
students can understand what is going on. We ran a whole summer school, and
did lots of playtesting. We'd get a different batch every week. They'd get
summer school credit, and we'd get bug reports. We were in there with our
notepads, and running everything through <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.jshint.com/">JSHint</a>. We were trying to provide errors that
were much more intuitive, but this wasn't explicitly a tech problem.
</p>

<p>
Q: You talked about "clubs" forming in the comments, I was wondering how far
you were willing to take the pseudo-social aspect? Are there plans to expend
into different languages or other types of programming?
</p>

<p>
A: Yes, in some areas. One immediately I think of, is humanities. I didn't
think about this initially, but the way in which you are making these programs,
and building a creative work, you spend lots of time, and you want people
to collaborate. This can happen for writing, poetry, art, music, all of
these things for which there isn't a model for teaching online. Having the
staffs and bars for composing music, and hearing the playback in real-time
would be great. Even better would be for live-forking and editing for
others to collaborate.
</p>

<p>
More immediate feedback on what projects students build is a goal.
</p>


<p>
The only other language we're looking to go into is HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
The huge advantage of JavaScript is that it can run natively, you don't need to
pass it back and forth. For now, we'll be sticking with browser native
languages.
</p>


<p>
Q: Khan Academy is free, right? How are you making money right now, and do you
see any change in the future?
</p>

<p>
A: We are funded by Grants. Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, The Carlos Slim
Foundation, and others. There is a lot of interest, and funding, and we aren't
in the position of every other education startup--where you're charging
teachers, schools, or students money. I don't want to be pinching pennies out
of students pockets. For additional revenue, we have contracts for folks
who are using our content in commercial contexts.
</p>

<p>
We do have <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/careers" target="_blank">lots of jobs,
tons of internships</a>. The whole CS platform was built
by me and interns, so if you wanna work with me and build cool stuff, please do.
