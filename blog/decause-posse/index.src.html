<h1>When last we left our hero...</h1>
<p>The year was 2015... Like most authors who revisit their previous works, I do <strong>NOT</strong> super-enjoy reading much of what I wrote way back when. For the sake of contuity, however, I am compelled to regenerate and redeploy these past posts for posterity.</p>
<p>Apologies/Congratulations.</p>
